# Co-op CheeseStack
Cheeseboard Catering Index
![cheeseboardIndexBanner](/images/cheeseboardindexbanner.png)

A catering menu and order processing database (for MEN stack CRUD app project).

Public menu and order enquiry form.
Create an account as a "New Staff" member for access to the menu and incoming orders.

Staff login allows you to **create**, **edit**, **update**, and **delete** menu options as well as **update** customer order status.

Inspired by my work experience as a cheese monger and love for charcuterie boards!

Stretch Goals
* Allow different authorizations based on staff user type- 'managers' have all access, and 'mongers' to have all viewing access to see the cheeseboard and their details, but cannot edit or delete cheeseboards
* If order status === 'complete', move the order into the Order History page.
* Color code the order status options: "enquiry" = green, "confirmed" = yellow, and "complete" = red
* Add alert messages to confirm you want to delete a board!
